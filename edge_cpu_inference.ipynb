    "However, for a variety of reasons including privacy, latency, and network connectivity or bandwidth constraints, it is often preferable to *use* these models (i.e. do inference) at “edge” devices located wherever the input data is/where the model’s prediction is going to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "These edge devices are less powerful and typically lack any special acceleration, so the inference time (the time from when the input is fed to the model, until the model outputs its prediction) may not be as fast as it would be on a cloud server - but we avoid having to send the input data to the cloud and then sending the prediction back."
