Containers can be easily created and destroyed which we will see in coming steps\n",

It simplifies the process of sharing and running applications by bundling them into a single image that can be easily distributed and executed on different computers. Here in the below code we used an Image named *python:3.9-slim* which is a light weight version of python and this image will make our container to run any of the python program easily.\n",
